# Headshots

Place your personal photo(s) here (JPG or PNG).

These are used by Gemini as reference images to composite your likeness into generated thumbnails.

## Tips for best results
- Clear, well-lit face
- Shoulders-up or waist-up framing
- Neutral or dark background (studio photo = best results)
- Multiple expressions/angles give more options

## Important
After reinstalling the skill, this folder is cleared.
**Keep your original photos backed up elsewhere** and copy them here again when needed.
